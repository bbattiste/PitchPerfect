# PitchPerfect

## Project Overview

You will make an iPhone app that will allow users to record their voice and will then modulate the recorded audio to sound like a Chipmunk or Darth Vader. This app will also let the user speed up or slow down the rate of playback, and experience fun echo and reverb effects.

## Why this project?

The first step in becoming an iOS Developer is to create your first app! Pitch Perfect provides a substantial, while not overly complicated, introduction to the iOS ecosystem.

## What will I learn?

You will learn how to:

<ul>
<li>Create a new project from existing iOS app templates</li>
<li>Add buttons, images, labels and create user interfaces for the app using the Storyboard</li>
<li>Leverage the Model View Controller (MVC) design principles; this includes writing custom model code, and using UIViewController, and UIView</li>
<li>Create Outlet and Action connections between the views and view controllers. Benefit from the power of Delegates by using them in code</li>
<li>Navigate between two scenes in the app using UINavigationController</li>
<li>Play audio files using AVFoundation’s AVAudioEngine class</li>
<li>Run the iOS simulator and download the app on a physical device</li>
<li>Search documentation, resolve bugs, and read other people’s code</li>
</ul>
  
# Why is this project meaningful to my career?

MVC is the cornerstone of all iOS app development; understanding these principles early sets you on the path to success. Learning how to find answers to development questions by searching documentation emulates the practice of expert software engineers.
